For my final project, I created a website for my work as a sound designer and audio integrator. The site is divided into 4 sections that are web responsive. The Navigation bar is responsive as well.

**Nav bar**: On small mobile devices, the menu is concealed with a hamburger menu. The menu drops below the name in the next size up, then moves to the right for larger devices and desktops.

**Top Section**: The hero image is swaped out depending on size so that small mobile devices won't get hung up on loading a large image.

**About Section**: The text and image reajust to fit for any screen size. The image is stacked on the text section for mobile devices. The image and text section are side by side for larger devices and desktop screens.

**Projects Section**: The images in this section are web responsive. For mobile sizes, they stack one on top of eachother. For medium sizes they stack as 2 columns. For larger sizes the stack as 3 columns. Each image blurs on hover (or tap for touch screens) and reveals the name of the projecct that that image represents. Clicking on each image in this section will reveal an overlay that links to an embedded video of the audio work done for that project. Clicking on the overlay will hide it again. The video player is also web responsive.

**Services Section**: When on mobile devices, the boxes in this section stack behind one another and turn into a carousel. They can be viewed via clicking through them with the arrows. On medium devices, the boxes stack as 2 columns. For desktops, the boxes stack as 3 colunms and a tilt effect is added.
