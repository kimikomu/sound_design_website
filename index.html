						<!-- <h2>Sound Design and Integration</h2> -->
						<h3>Unity | Programming | Audio</h3>
						<!-- <p class="sub_head"><b>video games and film</b></p> -->
						<p>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my portfolio site.</p>
						<p><b><u>Experience</u></b></p>
						<p>Unity - Over 6 years of professional Unity development for VR, WebGL, and desktop apps.</p>
						<p>Programming - Over 7 years of professional software development experience building various types of applications, including VR, websites, immersive training, automation, and data applications, among others. My expertise lies in real-time/game engine development.</p>
						<p>Audio - Over 8 years of professional audio design and engineering for both interactive digital projects and film.</p>
						<p><b><u>Approach</u></b></p>
						<p>The pursuit of sound design and programming has shaped my life in extremely positive ways, and I predict this will remain the same as we continue to turn new corners at incredible speed with technology. I approach both practices with the understanding that there will always be more to learn and discover, as both are constantly changing and evolving, while the core fundamentals of each continue to hold fast and true, providing solid ground to jump off of when experimenting and exploring.</p>
						<p><b><u>Engagement</u></b></p>
						<p>I am comfortable working solo to knock out tasks but also enjoy working and collaborating with others. I value kindness and curiosity and will bring these to any project I am a part of. If you need a programmer, asset implementor, audio designer and/or editor for your project, I'd be excited at a chance to jump in and support! I'll bet we can build some amazing things together.</p>

							Evolve builds a VR headset that focuses on biometric tracking and feedback. The VR content created for this headset focuses on helping individuals train their bodies to regulate themselves and their systems. As a Senior VR Developer at Evolve, I built several complete VR experiences and contributed to the other experiences made by the engineering team. I was responsible for all audio needs and updates and worked with their design contractor to ensure the sound was where it needed to be for each experience.

							Praxis Labs, a Learning and Development (L&D) startup, builds research-backed immersive training experiences to high-impact enterprise customers. Its mission is to make workplaces, and ultimately society, more equitable. I was a Unity developer on the engineering team and became the Audio Lead within a few weeks of working there. I programmed features and tools, implemented assets, and handled all audio for the development of this product's thirteen playable experiences. While working on this product, I was promoted to Senior Developer and was responsible for collaboration with all departments to ensure quality and timely deployment from AWS onto WebGL.

I explored and researched how WebGL, Three.js, and Needle worked together to create the audio system. I also extended some of Unity's code to properly handle how the Audio Context system comes online when on the web.

							In 2010, I had the privilege to work under some of the most talented individuals in the game audio industry. I had a contract gig with EA as an audio integrator for the modern release of Medal of Honor, which went on to be nominated for several audio awards. Working on this project with that amazing audio team taught me a lot about game audio and game development. It was an experience I continue to pull from in my creative pursuits.

							The idea behind this project was to Narrate an entire script like an audiobook, but also include voice actors and detailed sound design. The final project ended up being as long as a full-length movie feature. Every second was accompanied by a soundscape that I created. From old-west style gunfights to an avalanche and a monster yeti, this project offered plenty of great sound design opportunities and problem-solving that I thoroughly enjoyed.
